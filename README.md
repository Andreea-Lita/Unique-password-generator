# Unique-password-generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation is to generate a password as unique as possible and somewhat easy to remember! I built this application that a person can use to generate a random password based on criteria they have selected!
I learned that such an application could be useful, and from the coding point of view that there are several ways to code in javascript when you want to express an action.

## Installation
